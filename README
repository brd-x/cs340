I write programs that are maintainble, readable, and adaptable by following common code practices for organization, as well as clear and concise commentating. The CRUD module from project one is very simple and easy to read and use. This allows anybody to import the module and use the methods themselves.

I approach problems as a computer scientist by understanding why a problem is occuring. Understanding why an issue is happening allows me to understand the language more. The Grazioso software is different to past assignments because of the use of databases and Python/Mongo communication. The techniques I've learned from this project will help me develop databases for clients in the future.

Computer scientists develop a broad range of software, many of which the general population relies on. For example, the entire banking system runs off databases developed by computer scientists, and the importance this has on how we live is why it matters.
